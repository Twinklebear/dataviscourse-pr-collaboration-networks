- [Website](http://sci.utah.edu/~mliu/finalproject/). Our [data](http://sci.utah.edu/~mliu/finalproject/data_all/)
is also available from the website.

## Code

Under the `js/` folder is all of our Javascript for the visualization in D3. Under the `processing/` folder
are a few Python scripts we wrote for selecting, cleaning up and clustering entries from the DBLP database.

# Project Milestone

The milestone report is under [milestone\_report.pdf](milestone_report.pdf). Since our data is a bit too
large to include in the repository you can see our running prototype at [link](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~mliu/datavis/).
