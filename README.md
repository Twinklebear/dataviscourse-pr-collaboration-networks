- [Website](http://sci.utah.edu/~mliu/finalproject/). Our [data](http://sci.utah.edu/~mliu/finalproject/data_all/)
is also available from the website.

## Code

Under the `js/` folder is all of our Javascript for the visualization in D3. Under the `processing/` folder
are a few Python scripts we wrote for selecting, cleaning up and clustering entries from the DBLP database.

We make use of [d3.loadData](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/d3-js/3hHke9ZKfQM) for asynchronously
loading multiple data files at once. This library is located under [`js/loadData.js`](js/loadData.js).

# Project Milestone

The milestone report is under [milestone\_report.pdf](milestone_report.pdf). Since our data is a bit too
large to include in the repository you can see our running prototype at [link](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~mliu/datavis/).
